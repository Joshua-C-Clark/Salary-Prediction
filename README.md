<h1> Salary Predictions</h1>
<p>This project predicts the salary for various tech industry roles based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Potential Employer</li>
  <li>Job Location</li>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Job Subspecialty/Department</li>
  <li>Role</li>
</ul>

<p>Data for the project was obtained via web scraping scripts that were developed using Selenium. The scripts extracted data from dynamically loaded Javascript tables. For an overview of how to scrape a dynamically loaded table, please view my post on <a href = https://medium.com/@jcclark141152/data-extraction-from-dynamic-tables-9d9eafbd8064> Web Scraping. </a></p>

<p>The model was trained using a Random Forest Regression Ensemble.</p>
